                     MAKE Directory for the TINKER Package
                     -------------------------------------

        This subdirectory contains a Unix-style Makefile that can be used
        to build the TINKER modeling package. The provided file will need
        modification to point to the local TINKER directory, and for use
        with machine and compiler combinations not described near the top
        of the Makefile. A list of the dependencies of source files on
        each other is generated via the TINKER "document" program by
        running the "depend.make" script from within the source directory.

        Alternatively, TINKER can be built by running the compile.make,
        library.make and link.make scripts provided in machine specific
        directories of the TINKER distribution.
