                     FFTW Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains FFTW-3.3.8 which is the preferred Fast
      Fourier Transform (FFT) package for use with the OpenMP version
      of Tinker. The FFTPACK code provided as part of the Tinker source
      code can be used in place of FFTW via modifications to "fft3d.f".
      However FFTPACK is a serial code, and is not OpenMP parallel.

      Building FFTW on Linux and on macOS
      ###################################

      Under Linux and macOS, Tinker requires the two FFTW static object
      libraries, libfftw3.a and libfftw3_threads.a. To build FFTW using
      the GNU compilers, issue each of the commands indicated below.
      Note the "export" syntax is for use with bash shells, and must be
      modified for csh/tcsh shells. The --prefix flag in the "configure"
      command below should be changed to the correct path on your local
      machine (ie, the current /fftw area under the Tinker tree).

      export CC=gcc          (or "setenv CC gcc" for csh/tcsh)
      export F77=gfortran    (or "setenv F77 gfortran" for csh/tcsh)
      make distclean
      ./configure --prefix=/home/ponder/tinker/fftw --enable-threads \
                     --enable-openmp
      make
      make install

      The above "export" commands are for use with GNU compilers. To
      use the Intel or PGI compilers, substitute "icc" or "pgcc" for
      "gcc", and "ifort" or "pgf95" for "gfortran".

      After completion of the above commands, the library files needed
      by Tinker will be in the /lib subdirectory.

      Modified versions of the configure script are used to enforce
      processor-specific compiler flags. In particular, there are MacOS
      and Linux versions for the Intel compiler that use -axssse3 and
      -msse3, respectively, along with other optimization flags. The
      original file is available as "configure-orig".

      The configure script options --enable-threads and --enable-openmp
      create libfftw3_threads.a and libfftw3_omp.a, respectively. One or
      the other is needed for OpenMP versions of Tinker. Under MacOS and
      recent versions of the Intel compilers, the threads library seems
      to give better OpenMP performance on large numbers of cores.

      The additional configure script option --enable-mpi causes the
      libfftw3_mpi.a library to build. This MPI library is needed for
      Tinker-HP, but is not required, and can be omitted, when building
      standard OpenMP Tinker. In order to build the FFTW MPI library,
      you must already have OpenMPI or MPICH installed.

      Building FFTW on Windows
      ########################

      It is recommended to build FFTW under Cygwin on Windows via the
      procedure given above for Linux and using the MinGW GNU compilers.
      Once this is done, then build Tinker with the same compilers.

      Alternatively, the Intel compilers can build FFTW on Windows via
      Visual Studio and the add-on /fftw-3.3-libs subdirectory obtained
      from the FFTW web site. This has been tested on 64-bit Windows 7
      with Visual Studio 2010. In Visual Studio, open the project file
      /fftw-3.3-libs/fftw-3.3-libs.sln. Then under the Build menu, use
      the Configuration Manager to select x64 and build the Static-
      Release version of only the libfftw library. The resulting .lib
      file can be copied to the Tinker /source area for linking. Note
      the config.h file in /fftw-3.3-libs/libfftw-3.3 has been modified
      to enable use of threads and the calling interface with Fortran.
