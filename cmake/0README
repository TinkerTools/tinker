                    Building the Tinker Package Using CMake
                    #######################################

      The Tinker package can be built using the CMake compilation utility.
      CMake works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It requires the pkg-config
      and cmake-data packages, in addition to cmake.

      "cmake" is a command-line utility, and can be replaced in step 3 by
      "ccmake" for a text-based UI or cmake-gui for a graphical frontend.

      Note that before building Tinker, the FFTW libraries must be built or
      installed. These libraries can be built following the instructions in
      the file ../fftw/0README. Alternatively, are libraries are installed
      on Ubuntu Linux via the command "sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev".
      If multiple threaded FFTW libraries are installed, the linked version
      can be specified in step 3 with the flag "-DFFTW_THREAD_TYPE=omp".

      To change where the Tinker executables are installed, use the flag
      "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install" in step 3. This is useful
      in situations where the user may not have root privileges (e.g. on a
      computer cluster).

      To build Tinker with cmake, issue the following commands:

             (1) cd Tinker   [i.e., the top-level directory]
             (2) mkdir build && cd build
             (3) cmake ../cmake
             (4) make -j4    [replace 4 with # of processes to use]
             (5) make install

      A CMake module is included here to facilitate building Tinker with
      OpenMM libraries and CUDA. To turn on this capability, use the flag
      "-DTINKER_OPENMM=ON". This will try to find the OpenMM libraries
      in the default location (/usr/local/openmm) or in the location set
      by the environment variable OPENMM_PLUGIN_DIR or by passing the flag
      "-DOPENMM_DIR=/path/to/openmm". You do not need to build the base
      version of Tinker first, these steps will compile it automatically.

      To build Tinker with OpenMM libraries, issue the following commands:

             (1) cd Tinker   [i.e., the top-level directory]
             (2) mkdir build && cd build
             (3) cmake ../cmake -DTINKER_OPENMM=ON -DOPENMM_DIR=/path/to/openmm
             (4) make -j4    [replace 4 with # of processes to use]
             (5) make install
