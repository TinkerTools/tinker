                     TINKER Notes for GNU gfortran on Linux
                     ######################################

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Linux system
         using the GNU gfortran Fortran compiler.

         Building reasonably portable executables requires linking with
         static gcc libraries. This can be done via use of versions of 
         gfortran that enforce the -static-libgcc flag, or by copying 
         the static libraries from the gcc directories into the TINKER 
         build directory, as noted in "link.make".

         Please note that by default most Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes, as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large TINKER executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
