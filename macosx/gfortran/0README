                TINKER Notes for GNU gfortran on Macintosh OS X
                -----------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Macintosh OS X
         system using the GNU gfortran Fortran compiler. The current
         TINKER code builds correctly in serial under gfortran, but
         Open MP executables generally give a "Bus Error", perhaps due
         to problems with putting local arrays onto stack space.

         If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
         fault, check the limits for your processes by issuing the
         "limit" command at the tcsh shell prompt (or similar under
         other shells). By default, these limits are set to quite small
         values. To eliminate the problem issue the following commands:

                        limit datasize unlimited
                        limit stacksize unlimited

         These same commands can also be put in your .tcshrc file or
         equivalent startup file to be run at login time.
