                     TEST Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains some test casess illustrating use of several
      of the programs in the Tinker package.

      For example, the argon.run file contains commands to run the first
      test case. The resulting output is found in the file argon.log.

      The clean.make script will remove any output files generated during
      the example runs and should be invoked prior to validating Tinker
      executables against the provided log files.

      (1) ANION       estimates the free energy of hydration of Cl- anion
                      vs. Br- anion via a 2 picosecond simulation on a
                      "hybrid" anion in a box of water, followed by free
                      energy perturbation

      (2) ARGON       minimize, then perform 25 picoseconds of molecular
                      dynamics simulation, on a box with 150 argon atoms

      (3) CLUSTER     performs 10 Gaussian density annealing trials on a
                      cluster of 13 argon atoms to find the global minimum
                      energy structure

      (4) CRAMBIN     generate a Tinker XYZ file from a PDB file, followed
                      by single point energy computation and determination
                      of the molecular volume and surface area

      (5) CYCLOHEX    locate the transition state between chair and boat
                      cyclohexane via two methods: the Muller-Brown saddle
                      point method, and path sampling using the Elber
                      algorithm; vibrational analysis of the results shows
                      the same TS with one negative frequency

      (6) DHFR        run 10 molecular dynamics steps on pre-equilibrated
                      DHFR protein in water using the AMOEBA force field
                      (the so-called Joint Amber-CHARMM benchmark)

      (7) DIALANINE   find all local minima of alanine dipeptide via a
                      potential energy surface scan using torsional modes
                      to jump between minima

      (8) ENKEPHALIN  generate coordinates from amino acid sequence and
                      phi/psi angles, followed by energy minimization and
                      determination of the lowest frequency normal mode

      (9) ETHANOL     fit torsional parameter values for the C-C-O-H bond
                      based on relative quantum mechanical (G09) energies
                      for rotating the C-O bond

      (10) FORMAMIDE  generate a unit cell from fractional coordinates,
                      followed by full crystal energy minimization and
                      determination of optimal carbonyl oxygen parameters
                      via a fit to lattice energy and structure

      (11) GPCR       find the lowest-frequency bacteriorhodopsin normal
                      mode using a sliding block iterative diagonalization
                      (alter gpcr.run script to save the file gpcr.001 if
                      you want to view the mode; this example can require
                      up to an hour to complete)

      (12) HELIX      optimize rigid-body packing of two ideal polyalanine
                      helices using only van der Waals interactions

                      form using the iAMOEBA water model, neighbor lists
                      and PME electrostatics

      (14) IFABP      generate distance geometry structures for intestinal
                      fatty acid binding protein from NOE distances and
                      torsional restraints

      (15) METHANOL   process distributed multipole analysis (DMA) output
                      to extract coordinates and permanent multipoles, set
                      local frames and polarization groups, modify the
                      intramolecular polarization, and average equivalent
                      atomic sites

      (16) NITROGEN   calculate the self-diffusion constant and N-N radial

                      analysis of a 50ps MD trajectory

      (17) SALT       convert sodium chloride asymmetric unit to the unit
