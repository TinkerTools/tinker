                 TEST Directory for the TINKER Program Package
                 ---------------------------------------------

         This directory contains several examples illustrating use of
         several of the programs in the TINKER package.

         For example, the argon.run file contains the commands to run
         the first example on a Unix machine. The resulting output is
         found in the file argon.log.

         The clean.make script will remove any output files generated
         during the example runs and should be used prior to trying
         to validate TINKER executables against the provided log files.
