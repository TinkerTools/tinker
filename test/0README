                     TEST Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains some test casess illustrating use of several
      of the programs in the Tinker package.

      For example, the argon.run file contains commands to run the first
      test case. The resulting output is found in the file argon.log.

      The clean.make script will remove any output files generated during
      the example runs and should be invoked prior to validating Tinker
      executables against the provided log files.

      (1) ANION       estimates the hydration free energy difference for
                      Cl- vs. Br- anion via a 10 picosecond simulation

                      mode using a sliding block iterative diagonalization

                      you want to view the mode; this example can require
                      up to an hour to complete)
