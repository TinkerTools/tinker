                   TINKER Notes for Legacy Unix Workstations
                   ------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains TINKER build script files for a
          variety of proprietary Unix workstations. Note that these
          scripts and the corresponding flags were all tested and
          worked correctly under vendor-supplied Fortran 77 or 90/95
          compilers. The scripts have not been used in recent years,
          and are only provided as a starting point for anyone needing
          to build TINKER on these workstations. As of TINKER 6, the
          build process will require a Fortran 95 compiler instead
          of the Fortran 77 compilers typically used for TINKER 5 and
          earlier.versions.
