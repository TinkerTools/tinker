<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Welcome
to the TINKER molecular modeling package!  TINKER is designed to be an easily
used and flexible system of programs and routines for molecular mechanics and
dynamics as well as other energy-based and structural manipulation
calculations. It is intended to be modular enough to enable development of new
computational methods and efficient enough to meet most production calculation
needs. Rather than incorporating all the functionality in one monolithic
program, TINKER provides a set of relatively small programs that interoperate
to perform complex computations. New programs can be easily added by modelers
with only limited programming experience. The series of major programs
included in the distribution system perform the following core tasks:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;(1)&#9;building

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;(13)&#9;advanced

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Many of
the various energy minimization and molecular dynamics computations can be
performed on full or partial structures, over Cartesian, internal or rigid
body coordinates, and including a variety of boundary conditions and crystal
cell types. Other programs are available to generate timing data and allow
checking of potential function derivatives for coding errors. Special features
are available to facilitate input and output of protein and nucleic acid
structures. However, the basic core routines have no knowledge of biopolymer
structure and can be used for general molecular systems.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Due to
its emphasis on ease of modification, TINKER differs from many other currently
available molecular modeling packages in that the user is expected to be
willing to write simple ``front-end'' programs and make some alterations at
the source code level. The main programs provided should be considered as
templates for the users to change according to their wishes. All subroutines
are internally documented and structured programming practices are adhered to
throughout. The result, it is hoped, will be a calculational system which can
be tailored to local needs and desires.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The core
TINKER system consists of nearly 135,000 lines of source written entirely in a
portable Fortran77 superset. Use is made of only some very common extensions
that aid in writing highly structured code. The current version of the package
has been ported to a wide range of computers with no or extremely minimal
changes. Tested systems include: Red Hat Linux, Microsoft Windows
9X/NT/2000/XP, Apple OS9 and OSX, HP/Compaq/DEC Alphas under Tru64 Unix and
OpenVMS, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Silicon Graphics and Sun workstations under
each vendor's Unix. At present, our new code is written on various Linux
platforms, and occasionally tested for compatibility on various of the other
machine and OS combinations listed above. At present, we are in the process of
converting our primary development efforts from Fortran77 to a more modern
Fortran dialect. A machine-translated C version of TINKER is currently
available, and a hand-translated optimized C version of a previous TINKER
release is available for inspection. Conversion to C or C++ is under
consideration, but not being actively pursued at this time.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
basic design of the energy function engine used by the TINKER system allows
usage of several different parameter sets. At present we are distributing
parameters that implement AMBER ff94 and ff96, CHARMM19 and 27, MM2, MM3,
OPLS-UA, OPLS-AA, Liam Dang's polarizable potentials, and our own AMOEBA
(Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications)
parameters. In most cases, the source code separates the geometric
manipulations needed for energy derivatives from the actual form of the energy
function itself. Several other literature parameter sets are being considered
for possible future development (ENCAD, MMFF-94, MM4, UFF, <I>etc.)</I>, and
many of the alternative potential function forms reported in the literature
can be implemented directly or after minor code changes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Much of
the software in the TINKER package has been heavily used and well tested, but
some modules are still in a fairly early stage of development. Further work on
the TINKER system is planned in three main areas: (1) extension and
improvement of the potential energy parameters including additional
parameterization and testing of our polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field,
(2) coding of new computational algorithms including additional methods for
free energy determination, torsional Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics
sampling, advanced methods for long range interactions, better transition
state location, and further application of the potential smoothing paradigm,
and (3) further development of Force Field Explorer, a Java-based GUI
front-end to the TINKER programs that provides for calculation setup, launch
and control as well as basic molecular visualization.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
easiest way to get TINKER running on your machine is to use the
self-extracting installation kit for either Linux, Windows, or Macintosh OS X
10.3. The installer will guide you through complete setup of TINKER and the
Force Field Explorer (FFE) GUI, and perform all required configuration chores.
The installer kits for the three supported systems are </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker4.2-linux.sh</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">,
</FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker4.2-windows.exe</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
and </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker4.2-macosx.sit</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">.
The Linux and Windows kits each contain a private copy of a Java and Java3D
run-time environment for use with the package. The Macintosh version requires
an OS X 10.3 (Panther) system for installation. The native Java implementation
is used on Macs, and the Java3D package must be downloaded from Apple and
installed prior to using TINKER with Force Field Explorer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
TINKER package is also available as compressed Unix tar archives, Windows zip
files, and as a complete set of uncompressed source and data files. Binaries
are provided for machines running Windows 9X/ME/NT/2000/XP, Linux, and Apple
Mac OS X. All of these executables are present in standard compressed formats
as individual programs or as complete sets of executables. It is expected that
other Unix users and PC users who need specially customized versions, will
build binaries for their specific system. Sites with access to the Unix tar,
compress and uncompress commands should simply obtain the archive file </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker.tar.Z</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">.
Alternatively, </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker.tar.gz</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
and </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker.zip</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
containing identical distributions compressed to GNU gzip and Windows ZIP
format are also provided. If you choose to download individual files, you will
need at a minimum the contents of the /doc, /source and /params
subdirectories. Also required are the compile/build scripts from the
subdirectory named for your machine type. Other areas contain test cases and
examples, benchmark results, machine-translated C code, and the Force Field
Explorer Java GUI for TINKER. The entire TINKER package, after building the
executables, will require from about 40 to over 150 megabytes of disk space
depending on the components installed and the use of shared libraries in the executables.</FONT></FONT></P>

documentation for the TINKER programs, including the guide you are currently

prepared using the Applixware Words and Graphics programs. Portable versions
of the documentation are provided as ascii text in </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">.txt</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">

file formats. Please read and return by mail the TINKER license. In
particular, we note that TINKER is not ``Open Source'' as users are prohibited
from redistribution of original or modified TINKER source code or binaries to
other parties. While our intent is to distribute the TINKER code to anyone who
wants it, the Ponder Lab would like to remain the sole distribution site and
keep track of researchers using the package. The returned license forms also
help us justify further development of TINKER. When new modules and
capabilities become available, and when the almost inevitable bugs are
uncovered, we will attempt to notify those who have returned a license form.
Finally, we remind you that this software is copyrighted, and ask that it not
be redistributed in any form.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
compilation and building of the TINKER executables should be easy for most of
the common workstation and PC class computers. We provide in the /make area a
Unix-style Makefile that with some modification can be used to build TINKER on
most Unix machines. As a simpler alternative to Makefiles for the Unix
versions, we also provide machine-specific directories with three separate
shell scripts to compile the source, build an object library, and link binary
executables. Three similar command files are provided for Windows, Macintosh
and Open VMS systems. Compilation on Unix workstations should use the vendor
supplied Fortran compiler, if available. The public domain GNU g77 Fortran
compiler available from </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">http://gcc.gnu.org/</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
is also capable of building TINKER on Linux and other Unix-based machines. The
Linux executables we provide are built with the Intel Fortran for Linux 8.0
compiler. The Portland Group (PGI) and Absoft ProFortran compilers have also
been tested under Linux, both of which generate executables roughly comparable
in speed to the Intel compiler. On Linux, the g77 executables tend to exhibit
degraded performance compared with executables from commercial compilers. Some
benchmark results are provided in a later section of this User's Guide For the
Macintosh we distribute executables built under Apple OS X 10.3 with the GNU
g77 compiler. TINKER also builds on the Macintosh using the Absoft ProFortran
compiler. For PCs running Windows 9X/NT/2000/XP, the distributed TINKER
executables are built under the Intel Fortran for Windows 8.0 compiler.
Alternative Windows compilers such as Compaq Visual Fortran, Lahey/Fujitsu and
The Portland Group compilers, and GNU g77 under Cygwin have been tested and
shown to build TINKER correctly. Please see the README files in each of the
machine-specific areas for further information.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
first step in building TINKER using the script files is to run the appropriate </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">compile.make</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
script for your operating system and compiler version. Next you must use a </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">library.make</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
script to create an archive of object code modules. Finally, run a </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">link.make</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
script to produce the complete set of TINKER executables. The executables can
be renamed and moved to wherever you like by editing and running the
``rename'' script. These steps will produce executables that can run from the
command line, but without the capability to interact with the FFE GUI.
Building FFE-enabled TINKER executables involves replacing the </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">sockets.f</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
source file with sockets.c, and included the object from the C code in the
TINKER object library. Then executables must be linked against Java libraries
in addition to the usual resources. Sample </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">compgui.make</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
and </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">linkgui.make</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
scripts are provided for systems capable of building GUI-enabled executables.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Regardless
of your target machine, only a few small pieces of code can possibly require
attention prior to building. The first two are the system dependent time and
date routines found in </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">clock.f</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
and </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">calendar.f</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
respectively. Next is the </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">openend.f</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
routine that facilitates appending data to the end of an existing disk file.
Please uncomment the sections of these routines needed for your computer type.
Version of these system dependent routines suitable for each system are also
provided in the directory for each machine/OS type. The final set of possible
source alterations are to the master array dimensions found in the include
file </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">sizes.i</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">.
The most basic limit is on the number of atoms allowed, ``maxatm''. This
parameter can be set to 10000 or more on most workstations. Personal computers
with minimal memory may need a lower limit, perhaps 1000 atoms, depending on
available memory, swap space and other resources. A description of the other
parameter values is contained in the header of the file. Note that in order to
keep the code completely transparent, TINKER does not implement any sort of
dynamic memory allocation or heap data structure. This requires that </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">sizes.i</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
dimensioning values be set at least as large as the biggest problem you intend
to run. Obviously, you should not set the array sizes to unnecessarily large
values, since this can tax your compute resources and may result in
performance degradation or overt failure of the executables.</FONT></FONT></P>

package is distributed with several force field parameter sets, implementing a
selection of widely used literature force fields as well as the TINKER force
field currently under construction in the Ponder lab. We try to exactly
reproduce the intent of the original authors of our distributed, third-party
force fields. In all cases the parameter sets have been validated against
literature reports, results provided by the original developers, or
calculations made with the authentic programs. With the few exceptions noted
below, TINKER calculations can be treated as authentic results from the
genuine force fields. A brief description of each parameter set, including
some still in preparation and not distributed with the current version, is

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;This
section contains a description of the keyword parameters which may be used to
define or alter the course of a TINKER calculation. The keyword control file
is optional in the sense that all of the TINKER programs will run in the
absence of a keyfile and will simply use default values or query the user for
needed information. However, the keywords allow use of a wide variety of
algorithmic and procedural options, many of which are unavailable interactively.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Keywords
are read from the keyword control file. All programs look first for a keyfile
with the same base name as the input molecular system and ending in the
extension </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">.key</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">.
If this file does not exist, then TINKER tries to use a generic keyfile with
the name </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">tinker.key</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
and located in the same directory as the input system. If neither a system
specific nor a generic keyfile is present, TINKER will continue by using
default values for keyword options and asking interactive questions as necessary.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;TINKER
searches the keyfile during the course of a calculation for relevant keywords
that may be present. All keywords must appear as the first word on the line.
Any blank space to the left of the keyword is ignored, and all contents of the
keyfiles are case insensitive. Some keywords take modifiers; <I>i.e.</I>,
TINKER looks further on the same line for additional information, such as the
value of some parameter related to the keyword. Modifier information is read
in free format, but must be completely contained on the same line as the
original keyword. Any lines contained in the keyfile which do not qualify as
valid keyword lines are treated as comments and are simply ignored.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Several
keywords take a list of integer values (atom numbers, for example) as
modifiers. For these keywords the integers can simply be listed explicitly and
separated by spaces, commas or tabs. If a range of numbers is desired, it can
be specified by listing the negative of the first number of the range,
followed by a separator and the last number of the range. For example, the
keyword line </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">ACTIVE 4 -9 17 23</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
could be used to add atoms 4, 9 through 17, and 23 to the set of active atoms
during a TINKER calculation.</FONT></FONT></P>

end the search for the highest available version number; <I>i.e.</I>, version

TYPES VS. ATOM CLASSES</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Manipulation
of atom types and the proliferation of parameters as atoms are further
subdivided into new types is the bane of force field calculation. For example,
if each topologically distinct atom arising from the 20 natural amino acids is
given a different atom type, then about 300 separate type are required (this
ignores the different N- and C-terminal forms of the residues, diastereotopic
hydrogens, <I>etc</I>.). However, all these types lead to literally thousands
of different force field parameters. In fact, there are many thousands of
distinct torsional parameters alone. It is impossible at present to fully
optimize each of these parameters; and even if we could, a great many of the
parameters would be nearly identical. Two somewhat complimentary solutions are
available to handle the proliferation of parameters. The first is to specify
the molecular fragments to which a given parameter can be applied in terms of
a chemical structure language, SMILES strings for example. Some commercial
systems, such as the TRIPOS Sybyl software, make use of such a scheme to parse
structures and assign force field parameters.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;A second
general approach is to use hierarchical cascades of parameter groups. TINKER
uses a simple version of this scheme. Each TINKER force field atom has both an
atom <I>type</I> number and an atom <I>class</I> number. The types are subsets
of the atom classes, <I>i.e.</I>, several different atom types can belong to
the same atom class. Force field parameters that are somewhat less sensitive
to local environment, such as local geometry terms, are then provided and
assigned based on atom class. Other energy parameters, such as electrostatic
parameters, that are very environment dependent are assigned over the atom
types. This greatly reduces the number of independent multiple-atom parameters
like the four-atom torsional parameters.</FONT></FONT></P>

ON PARTIAL STRUCTURES</FONT></FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Two
methods are available for performing energetic calculations on portions or
substructures within a full molecular system. TINKER allows division of the
entire system into <I>active</I> and <I>inactive</I> parts which can be
defined via keywords. In subsequent calculations, such as minimization or
dynamics, only the active portions of the system are allowed to move. The
force field engine responds to the active/inactive division by computing all
energetic interactions involving at least one active atom; <I>i.e.</I>, any
interaction whose energy can change with the motion of one or more active
atoms is computed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;The
second method for partial structure computation involves dividing the original
system into a set of atom <I>groups</I>. As before, the groups can be
specified via appropriate keywords. The current TINKER implementation allows
specification of up to a maximum number of groups as given in the </FONT><B><TT><FONT FACE="courier, courier new">sizes.i</FONT></TT></B><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">
dimensioning file. The groups must be disjoint in that no atom can belong to
more than one group. Further keywords allow the user to specify which intra-
and intergroup sets of energetic interactions will contribute to the total
force field energy. Weights for each set of interactions in the total energy
can also be input. A specific energetic interaction is assigned to a
particular intra- or intergroup set if all the atoms involved in the
interaction belong to the group (intra-) or pair of groups (inter-).
Interactions involving atoms from more than two groups are not computed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Note
that the groups method and active/inactive method use different assignment
procedures for individual interactions. The active/inactive scheme is intended
for situations where only a portion of a system is allowed to move, but the
total energy needs to reflect the presence of the remaining inactive portion
of the structure. The groups method is intended for use in rigid body
calculations, and is needed for certain kinds of free energy perturbation calculations.</FONT></FONT></P>

energy switching over a window is used for terms whose energy is small near

Ewald method is preferred when periodic boundary conditions are present,
TINKER's shifted energy switch with reasonable switching windows is quite
satisfactory for most routine modeling problems. The shifted energy switch
minimizes the perturbation of the energy and the gradient at the cutoff to
acceptable levels. Problems should arise only if the property you wish to

real-space cutoff distance must be set to reasonable and complementary values.
Additional control variables for regular Ewald are the fractional coverage and
number of vectors used in reciprocal space. For PME the additional control
values are the B-spline order and charge grid dimensions. Complete control
over all of these parameters is available via the TINKER keyfile mechanism. By

alternative continuum solvation algorithms are contained within TINKER. All of
these are accessed via the SOLVATE keyword and its modifiers. Two simple
surface area methods are implemented: the ASP method of Eisenberg and
McLachlan, and the SASA method from Scheraga's group. These methods are
applicable to any of the standard TINKER force fields. Various schemes based
on the generalized Born formalism are also available: the original 1990
numerical ``Onion-shell'' GB/SA method from Still's group, the 1997 analytical
GB/SA method also due to Still, a pairwise descreening algorithm originally
proposed by Hawkins, Cramer and Truhlar, and the analytical continuum
solvation (ACE) method of Schaefer and Karplus. At present, the generalized
Born methods should only be used with force fields having simple partial
charge electrostatic interactions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Some
further comments are in order regarding the GB/SA-style solvation models. The
``Onion-shell'' model is provided mostly for comparison purposes. It uses an
exact, analytical surface area calculation for the cavity term and the
numerical scheme described in the original paper for the polarization term.
This method is very slow, especially for large systems, and does not contain
the contribution of the Born radii chain rule term to the first derivatives.
We recommend its use only for single-point energy calculations. The other
GB/SA methods (``analytical'' Still, H-C-T pairwise descreening, and ACE) use
an approximate cavity term based on Born radii, and do contain fully correct
derivatives including the Born radii chain rule contribution. These methods
all scale in CPU time with the square of the size of the system, and can be
used with minimization, molecular dynamics and large molecules.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;Finally,
we note that the ACE solvation model should not be used with the current
version of TINKER. The algorithm is fully implemented in the source code, but
parameterization is not complete. As of late 2000, parameter values are only
available in the literature for use of ACE with the older CHARMM19 force
field. We plan to develop values for use with more modern all-atom force
fields, and these will be incorporated into TINKER sometime in the future.</FONT></FONT></P>

the development of TINKER.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">Still other
workers have devoted considerable time in developing code that will hopefully
be incorporated into future TINKER versions; for example, <B>Jim Kress</B>
(UFF implementation) and <B>Michael Sheets</B> (numerous code optimizations,
thermodynamic integration). Finally, we wish to thank the many users of the
TINKER package for their suggestions and comments, praise and criticism, which
have resulted in a variety of improvements.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="New Century Schoolbook">&#9;This
section contains a list of the references to general theory, algorithms and
implementation details which have been of use during the development of the
TINKER package. Methods described in some of the references have been
implemented in detail within the TINKER source code. Other references contain
useful background information although the algorithms themselves are now
obsolete. Still other papers contain ideas or extensions planned for future
inclusion in TINKER. References for specific force field parameter sets are
provided in an earlier section of this User's Guide. This list is heavily
skewed toward biomolecules in general and proteins in particular. This bias
reflects our group's major interests; however an attempt has been made to
include methods which should be generally applicable.</FONT></FONT></P>
